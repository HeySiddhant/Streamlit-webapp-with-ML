# Streamlit-webapp-with-ML

Welcome to Streamlit ðŸ‘‹
A faster way to build and share data apps.

What is Streamlit?
Streamlit lets you transform Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes, instead of weeks. Build dashboards, generate reports, or create chat apps. Once youâ€™ve created an app, you can use our Community Cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share your app.

Installation
Open a terminal and run:

$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello

If this opens our sweet Streamlit Hello app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to our docs for specific installs.
